I created a web app using Streamlit and SciKit Learn that visualizes data from a Kaggle dataset containing data on Big Mac Prices over the last 20 years in 76 countries worldwide. I used Numpy and Pandas to parse the data in the CSV file and SciKit Learn to create a simple Linear Regression Model that predicts future Big Mac Prices in various countries. Streamlit is a python library that generates HTML, CSS, and Javascript from Python commands allowing a user to quickly create simple websites with little knowledge of front-end development.
